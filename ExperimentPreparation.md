# Experiment Preparation
## Goal
Get ImprovingU to a state of a welcoming community by April 1st.

## Motivation
We want to provide improvers confidence, direction, and clarity on how to get started with low ramp up time.

## Potential Tasks
Potential tasks for the maintainers to figure out and documented for transparency:
- Contributing guideline to running locally and submitting work
- Transparency on maintainers - add maintainers to README
- Issues triaged appropriately
  - First timers should have a good list of issues to pick (easy, takes a very short amount of time, enough
  to understand the process)
  - issue labelling and triaging strategy?
- Project goals and/or roadmap
  - rewrite only?
  - new features?
  - experiment work on separate branch completely or always delivering value along side
  - etc..
- Additional technical decisions and setup
  - state management?
  - webpack
  - separate frontend
  - typescript?
  - etc..
  > We may want to create a project board or something equivalent to manage tasks to achieve our goal
